            <p><i>By Ash Reynolds</i></p>
            
            <p>Southern California Edison, which provides electricity to the Los Angeles area, abruptly terminated an agreement with a disability disaster relief group to provide services to disabled residents of the fire-prone region. </p>

            <p>In October, the utility ended its approximately $4 million contract with the <a href='https://disabilitydisasteraccess.org/' target='_blank'> Disability Disaster Access & Resources (DDAR) program</a>, according to program officials, even though the contract was initially set to last until 2026. DDAR’s partnership with Edison supported wellness checks, emergency transportation,disaster-preparedness training, and other emergency services for disabled residents.</p>

            <p>Edison’s existing programs and partnership with the 211 emergency hotline had rendered the disabled-services agreement “duplicative and unnecessary,” according to <a href='https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M580/K788/580788967.PDF' target='_blank'>a ruling</a> from the California Public Utilities Commission. DDAR officials and disabled community members do not agree.</p>

            <p>“The majority of our coordinators are part of the [disabled] community,” said Serra Rea, program manager for DDAR. “We understand the disability world a lot better than utility corporate.”</p>

            <p>DDAR is a project of the <a href="https://cfilc.org/" target="_blank">California Foundation for Independent Living Centers (CFILC)</a>, a non-profit that works with independent living centers in the state to help people with disabilities maintain their independence with trainings, counseling, systemic advocacy and more. Most of the people who work in these Independent Living Centers are themselves living with disabilities. </p>

            <p>Program officials say that DDAR is better suited than Edison and 211 to ensure people with disabilities are accommodated fairly without sacrificing their independence.</p>

            <p>“211 is simply a referral system,” said CFILC’s Communications and Strategic Partnerships manager Russell Dawson Rawlings. “Nine times out of ten, if it's disability [related], they're going to direct somebody to an independent living center.”</p>

            <p>The cancellation of the contract also comes as the CEO of Edison International, Southern California Edison’s parent company, announced in a quarterly earnings report that faulty company equipment was the <a href="https://abc7.com/post/socal-edison-equipment-cause-eaton-fire-altadena-ceo-says/18082954/" target="_blank">“likely”</a> cause of the Eaton fire, which decimated Altadena in early 2025, causing at least 19 deaths (most of whom were elderly or disabled), destroying more than a thousand structures, and creating environmental conditions that will keep some <a href="airquality.html">disabled residents from returning to the area.</a></p>
            
            <p>According to Jeff Monford, a spokesperson for Edison, the decision to terminate the contract was not made by Edison but by the state Public Utilities Commission.</p>

            <p>“The Commission decides what [Edison] is allowed to spend,” said Monford. “So we routinely ask for more than they allow … Part of all of that decision-making process means that not everything we seek is approved.”</p>

            <p>Foundation officials suspect that Edison is shifting responsibility for its own decision onto the Public Utilities Commission.</p>

            <p>“They are using the CPUC as a shelter to back it up,” said Rawlings. “However, we know now independent living centers are scrambling to continue to support people with no funding now they've taken away our capacity.”</p>

            <p>During and after the Eaton fire, independent living centers across Los Angeles offered crucial assistance to people with disabilities. With the contract terminated, some of those same services are now unavailable or will be administered only through Edison. Rawlings and Rea say independent living center clients may have a hard time trusting Edison.</p>

            <p>Dr. EJ Lutz, a disabled Angeleno and client of an independent living center in west Los Angeles, has been unable to return home for more than a few days at a time since January, due to lingering smoke damage in their apartment. Lutz said that the independent living center (Disability Community Resource Center) was one of few places offering helpful assistance post-fire.</p>

            <p>“[DCRC] is the only program that consistently sent emails, made check-in phone calls, kept checking on my health,” Lutz wrote in a letter of support for DDAR and Edison’s partnership. “They gave me a battery so that I could use some of my medical equipment, needed to breathe, even though I am living in my car.”</p>

            <p>While the partnership between DDAR and Edison was useful to people with disabilities during the fires, it was initially conceived as a way to help people with disabilities in the event of a public-safety power shut-off. </p>

            <p>These power shut offs occur when the risk of fire is high: meaning low humidity, or high wind speeds. The Eaton fire in January was born in these conditions, with an extremely dry climate and Santa Ana winds of nearly 70 mph fueling the fires.</p>

            <p>Rea, who has been working in disaster response since 2019, says these power shutoffs have been becoming more frequent. As climate change worsens dry conditions in the region and strengthens winds, power outages and fires will likely become even more so.</p>

            <p>“There is no such thing as fire season,” said Rea. “Fire season is year round now.”</p>

            <p>While Edison’s in-event battery loan program and partnership with 211 may be able to cover some of the services provided by DDAR under the partnership, foundation officials say that some gaps just can’t be filled by an energy corporation. Able-bodied people may be able to stay in their homes in the event of a power outage, but people with disabilities may not be afforded that same privilege. When Edison is unable to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities in their homes, they may relocate them to a hotel, according to Rea and Rawlings.</p>

            <p>“They do not give them the opportunity to stay independent,” said Rea. <span class="highlight">"Edison is taking their independence away.”</span></p>
